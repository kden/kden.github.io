# A Note to Employers Regarding the Use of AI

As I write this, in July of 2025, both employers and potential employees are struggling greatly with the use of AI.  Job postings are inundated with automatically-generated applications.  Cover letters are no longer a useful indicator of someone's writing abilities. Potential employees are screened out by opaque criteria that make no distinction between auto-generated applications and applications that have been labored over for hours.  There are no tools that have been proven to reliably detect AI.

I would discourage employers from forbidding developers from using AI or documentation in coding exams.  For one thing, that's not an accurate reflection of what they will have access to on the job.  Someone with a great memory is not necessarily the  person who will have other strengths, like critical thinking or creativity.  For another thing, you will end up rewarding people for being dishonest.  Your applicants will be in the sad and difficult position of choosing between cheating or being routinely outperformed by those who do.

Based on my recent experience in the job market, I'd suggest the following:

1. Use take-home exams, and allow the use of AI with disclosure.  One of the best-done interview processes I went through took this approach.
   Provide some, but not all of the test cases for the assignment.  

Finally, in the interview, ask them questions about the code and make sure they can
explain how all of it works.  Ask them what features they would add.  Ask them what challenges they ran into.  Try to aim for an assignment that won't take more than a couple of hours.  Asking someone to do 2 days of unpaid work is a big investment for a job you may not get.  

I also prefer take-home exams because they are the easiest to adjust for people with disabilities.  You can easily use your own tools for a take-home. You can also work around your schedule.  Additionally, if someone is willing to put in some extra time to do a good job, I don't think they should be penalized for that.  

2. Allow AI and documentation searches for online coding exams.  Use a coding tool that will let them run some predefined test cases and hold back some test cases.
   Again, after the exam, you can ask them to explain what everything does.

3. Consider offering the position as a contract-to-hire position.  Realistically, to know if someone is going to be able to do the job, the best test is to let them do the job.  The interview and job hiring process has been marginally effective since long before the widespread availability of AI.

I'd like to end with what's either an apocryphically true internet story or a Dad joke:  "Once, I had a boss who would take the stack of resumes for any job application, shuffle them, and toss half right in the trash.  Naturally I was appalled.  I asked him
why he did it.  He said, 'I don't want to hire any unlucky people.'"  

We don't always acknowledge how hard and time consuminghiring is, but it is one of the most important roles you can have.  That investment can have a huge positive or negative impact on your organization.
