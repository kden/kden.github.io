Like many software engineers, the vast majority of the code I've worked on over the course of my career has been proprietary, so I can't make it part of my portfolio.  Unless otherwise stated, projects on this page were done on my own time.

Use of AI has been disclosed where applicable.  The text of this portfolio was written without AI.
