The test site is an approximately 133ft x 33ft lot, located in Madison, Wisconsin, mostly shaded by mature trees along the property lines.

I plotted out the test site in 10 foot increments a year ago for a different project.  The (0,0) position is in the southern corner of the lot.

For the web application, the grid is rotated so that (0,0) is in the upper left, because it seemed like the landscape orientation would be preferable for the [app](https://sunlight.codepaw.com/).
