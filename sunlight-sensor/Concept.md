## Concept

[Permaculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture) is a sustainable approach to land use, emphasizing a self-sustaining, regenerative ecosystem.  Farmers and gardeners are experimenting with permaculture techniques to use land in a way more compatible with natural ecosystems.

One important concept in permaculture planning is [microclimates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microclimate).  A microclimate is a small area that has a different climate than the surrounding area. If you have a small yard, but want to incorporate features of different ecosystems, you can find or create microclimates that support different plants and animals.  

To plan what plants to put in a microclimate, you need to know things like the amount of sunlight, humidity, and temperature. Sensors for these conditions have become rather inexpensive, and it's possible that a homeowner or hobby farmer could use them to map their various microclimates.
